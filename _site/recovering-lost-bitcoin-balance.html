<p>In a nutshell: you need to have a <a href="setting-up-bitcoin-wallet.html#mnemonic-code">mnemonic code</a> saved <em>before</em> your balance is lost, either as plain 12 words or in encrypted form.</p>

<p>Here are en exact steps to take when a wallet password is forgotten or a phone itself is no longer accessible for whatever reason:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you still have an access to your phone then first of all you should erase all current app data. If you don’t know how to erase an app data then just reinstall an application from scratch. If you no longer have an access to your phone then install an app once again on a new phone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open a fresh application and you’ll be given an option to restore an existing Bitcoin wallet instead of creating a new one. Choose it and enter your mnemonic code as well as new wallet password. This is it, no further action is required.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Important note: restored wallet will appear empty at first and that is completely normal as it needs some time to catch up with network.</em></p>

<h3 id="when-wallet-is-restored-but-the-balance-is-still-zero">When wallet is restored but the balance is still zero</h3>

<p>If you don’t see a balance restored for a long time then first of all you should make sure an app has no connectivity issues. Normally a well connected app displays syncing progress and shows a <em>Bitcoin wallet is online</em> message once syncing is done.</p>

<p>A case when an app is indeed well connected and synced but you still see a zero balance and no transaction history means that your mnemonic contains a typo somewhere.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate a typo you can compare your saved mnemonic code with a <a href="english-bip32.json">list of all possible words</a>. An in-page search may be used there to check if every word from your mnemonic is also present on a list, in case if it’s not there just fix a typo and you’re done.</p>

<p>Also, mnemonic code should be entered very carefully when restoring a wallet since an app will accept any string while a single typo is a single word will result in totally different wallet.</p>
