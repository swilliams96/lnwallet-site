      <h3 id="storage-tokens"><a href="#storage-tokens"></a>Storage tokens</h3>

<p>These are special cryptographic entities provided by Olympus server in exchange for a Lightning payment. You can think of them as one-off tickets which can be used to anonymously store such data as <a href="reimbursing-funds-locked-in-a-lost-payment-channel.html#reimbursing-funds-locked-in-a-lost-payment-channel">channel backups</a> and <a href="what-does-olympus-server-do.html#what-does-olympus-server-do">scheduled Bitcoin transactions</a> on Olympus server.</p>

<p>Currently an automatic Lightning payment of 2000 Satoshi to get 50 storage tokens is issued by wallet when a first <a href="using-lightning-wallet.html#payment-channel">payment channel</a> is created. Once obtained these tokens are stored in a wallet while being spent gradually and automatically as the need comes by.</p>

<h3 id="reasons-for-storage-tokens-to-exist"><a href="#reasons-for-storage-tokens-to-exist"></a>Reasons for storage tokens to exist</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is no incentive for me the developer to maintain a public Olympus server without getting paid for it somehow. Accepting micropayments for some useful API calls seems like a good idea but using a Lightning payment per each call is an overkill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goal is to keep Lightning Wallet as private as possible so any kind of traditional approach like registration and user accounts is a no-go. But at the same time simply allowing anonymous users to store any amount of data on a server is an obvious attack vector.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Storage tokens solve both of these issues beautifully: a single Lightning micropayment gives you an access to 50 API calls and technically speaking these storage tokens are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature">blind signatures</a> which posess an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-hansen-privacy-terminology-00.html#unlinkability">unlinkability property</a> so every API call made by your wallet is anonymous and private.</p>

<p>All that said, you can opt out of this at any moment by <a href="what-does-olympus-server-do.html#setting-up-your-own-server">setting up your own Olympus server</a> which would use a free public key based authentication instead of paid tokens.</p>
