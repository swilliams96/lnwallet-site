      <h3 id="using-lightning-wallet"><a href="#using-lightning-wallet"></a>Using Lightning wallet</h3>

<p>Once Bitcoin wallet is created you can also start using a Lightning wallet by opening a payment channel with a peer of your choice and using it to send payments across a Lightning network.</p>

<h3 id="payment-channel"><a href="#payment-channel"></a>Payment channel</h3>

<p>Technically speaking it is a multisig lockbox on a Bitcoin blockchain which is mutually controlled by you and a peer of your choice. It is designed in such a way that once a certain amount of coins is locked in there you can use those coins to send and receive Lightning payments.</p>

<p>You can close a payment channel and get the rest of your locked coins back to your Bitcoin wallet at any time, either by agreeing with a peer on a mutual closing transaction or via forced channel closing if your peer becomes uncooperative.</p>

<h3 id="forced-channel-closing"><a href="#forced-channel-closing"></a>Forced channel closing</h3>

<p>This is an option which is always available to both you and your peer once a new payment channel is open. No matter what happens a channel can always be closed without peer’s permission with the rest of channel balance refunded back to your Bitcoin wallet.</p>

<p>That said, a refunding Bitcoin transaction created by forced channel closing is encumbered in a time lock of 144 Bitcoin blocks so closing a channel uncooperatively will take about one day of waiting before your channel coins are sent back to your Bitcoin wallet.</p>

<p>You may also want to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-WJPjAp5u8">this video</a> which covers all the ways a payment channel could be closed.</p>

<h3 id="stuck-payments"><a href="#stuck-payments"></a>Stuck payments</h3>

<p>An outgoing Lightning payment may get stuck due to a buggy or malicious node along a payment route. In such a case you would have to wait until it expires which may take quite a number of Bitcoin blocks. Once expiry happens a payment will be failed and you will get an in-flight funds back to your Lightning wallet.</p>

<h3 id="receiving-lightning-funds"><a href="#receiving-lightning-funds"></a>Receiving Lightning funds</h3>

<p>…is tricky as there are some conditions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing can be received once a fresh channel is created since a room for incoming funds should be first made by spending. <em>A payment channel can be thought of as a full bottle of water: in order to pour something in one first has to pour something out</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each channel implicitly contains a reserve which is unspendable off-chain and typically takes about 1% of channel capacity. One has to spend that reserve before receiving is allowed. <em>Unspendable channel reserve is the reason you see a negative receive limit when a new channel is full. It indicates how much you need to spend before anything could be received</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every payment request is disposable, it can’t be fulfilled multiple times. So one would have to issue a payment request per each incoming payment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lightning wallet needs to be online in order to receive funds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="commit-transaction-fee"><a href="#commit-transaction-fee"></a>Commit transaction fee</h3>

<p>Sending each Lightning payment creates a valid Bitcoin transaction which is kept off-chain, in fact it never even leaves your device unless a forced channel closing happens. This <em>commit transaction</em> must have an appropriate fee for Bitcoin network to accept it in a timely manner.</p>

<p>As a consequence an actual amount available for spending in a payment channel will always be slightly less than a nominal amount because it always needs to contain enough funds for a current Bitcoin <em>commit transaction fee</em>.</p>
