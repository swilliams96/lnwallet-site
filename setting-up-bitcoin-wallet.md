### [](#setting-up-bitcoin-wallet)Setting up Bitcoin wallet

Right after an app is installed it offers to create a new Bitcoin wallet which lets you send and receive regular Bitcoin transactions. Wallet data is always stored encrypted on your device so you would have to come up with a passcode of your choice while creating it.

Every new Bitcoin wallet is generated randomly and hence it's not tied to your device in any specific way. This is an important point which in particular means that just reinstalling an app and creating another Bitcoin wallet won't by default restore your previous balance, you would have a completely new wallet instead!

There is, however, a simple way to preserve your balance across app reinstalls and even across different devices: <strong><font color="red">you need to write down a mnemonic code once Bitcoin wallet is created</font></strong>.

### [](#mnemonic-code)Mnemonic code

It is essentially a secret phrase comprising of 12 random words which is automatically generated by application when a new wallet is created. Please remember: whoever knows your mnemonic code also fully controls your bitcoins so it should be kept private at all times.

Also, <strong><font color="red">only mnemonic code can get your bitcoins back in case if you lose your device or forget your wallet password or simply uninstall an app by accident, it's that important!</font></strong> One of the following actions should be taken once a new wallet is created:

- Either write your mnemonic code on a piece of paper and store it in a really secure place.
- Or use a built-in "Encrypt and export" option which lets you store a mnemonic code in encrypted form using your wallet secret as a decryption key.

### [](#summary)Summary

In general there are two different pieces of private data associated with your wallet: mnemonic code and wallet passcode. 

Passcode is required to send coins from within an app and mnemonic code is the only way to restore your balance in emergency situations such as lost/stolen device, forgotten passcode, uninstalled app etc.
